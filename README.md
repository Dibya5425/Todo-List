By using HTML, CSS, Jquery UI and Jquery.     
link for the To-DO List App- https://dibya5425.github.io/Todo-List/    
In this app we can sort our list of task as category wise. we can also add multiple catagory as well as task which we want to complete.
## Motto of this App
_Add your tasks, Organize your life, Achieve more every day._
